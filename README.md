## Ethan's Oracle APEX SAAS_AUTH Package

This package is used to support the custom authentication form which can be found in my APEX demo application. 

### Instructions

* [Install ARCSQL](https://e-t-h-a-n.com/how-to-install-arcsql). Install this first. It is a required prerequisite for SAAS Auth.
* [SAAS Auth](https://e-t-h-a-n.com/how-to-configure-apex-to-use-my-custom-login-page) install instructions.
